# Machine Learning Course

## Andrew Ng's Stanford University Machine Learning Course (Coursera)

Assignments for this course are written in Octave and Matlab. Beware there may contain mistakes. 

### Assignment 1 - Linear Regression
Linear regression with one variable to predict profits for a food truck. 

### Assignment 2 - Logistic Regression & Regularized Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression to predict whether a student will get admitted into university.
Regularized logistic regression to predict whether microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assurance.

### Assignment 3 - Multi-class Classification & Neural Networks
Implement one-vs-all logistic regression and neural networks to recognize hand-written digits.
Logistic regression to recognize handwritten digits using multiple one-vs-all logistic regression models to build a multi-class classifier.
Implement a neural network to recognize handwritten digits. The neural network will be able to represent complex models that form non-linear hypotheses. Implement the feedforward propagation algorithm for prediction.

### Assignment 4 - Neural Networks Learning 
Implement the backpropagation algorithm for neural networks and apply it to the task of hand-written digit recognition. Implement the backpropagation algorithm to learn the parameters for the neural network

### Assignment 5

### Assignment 6

### Assignment 7

### Assignment 8
