# Machine Learning Course

## Andrew Ng's Stanford University Machine Learning Course (Coursera)

Assignments for this course are written in Octave and MatLab. Beware there may contain mistakes. 

### Assignment 1 - Linear Regression
Linear regression with one variable to predict profits for a food truck. 

### Assignment 2 - Logistic Regression & Regularized Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression to predict whether a student will get admitted into university.
Regularized logistic regression to predict whether microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assurance.

### Assignment 3 - Multi-class Classification & Neural Networks
Logistic regression to recognize handwritten digits
Implement a neural network to recognize handwritten digits using the same training set as before. The neural network will be able to represent complex models that form non-linear hypotheses.
